# Circuit-Design-and-Simulations-for-timing-analysis-and-PLD
This is an assignment for the module _EN2110 ELECTRONICS 3_ which I'm learning at my university.

There are two main parts,
1. __Parasitic Effect in Timing Analysis.__
   - Design a 3 Stage Ring Oscillator then find the correlation parasitic effect & oscillation period.
2. __Design a Programmable Logic Device (PLD).__
   - Design a programmable logic block with one selection bit.
   - Design a single switch matrix using a six pass transistor.
   - Design a PLD which can be used to design any 3 input combinational circuit.
